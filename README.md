# Immune-Sim: Cancer-Immune System Simulator

This is a simplified simulation of tumor and immune cell dynamics, based on control theory models from my master's thesis.

## ðŸ“Œ Features
- Simulates tumor growth and immune response over 100 days
- Uses simple differential dynamics with parameters
- Outputs graph and CSV for data visualization

## ðŸ“Š Output
- Tumor Cells, Immune Cells, and Cytokines over time
- Plot image: `output_plot.png`
- Raw data: `example_output.csv`

## ðŸ”§ How to Use
Run `simulate.py` with Python. It will generate:
- A CSV file of the simulated data
- A line plot showing tumor and immune dynamics

## ðŸ§ª Thesis Context
This simulation is part of my master's thesis on **Direct Adaptive Iterative Learning Control in Cancer Immunotherapy**, where I modeled immune-tumor interaction using fuzzy neural networks and adaptive control strategies.
